# Brefing 10 (4/22/2020)
## Hey people! So I'm going to start doing the Briefings like this now. It's easier for me to format and it serves the same purpose. Now, for the news:<br>
<br>

**The internal survival build was last updated 4 days ago.** This might mean nothing but it most likely means that this is a pretty stable build. I'd expect some updates in the coming days but this might even be the last one (Unprobable but still a possiblity)<br>

<br>

**A new seat is visible in the new gif.** It's basically an egg seat.<br>

<br>

**There's now pipe chests in survival.** Seen in the last gif, it looks like there will be a chest variety that allows you to connect it to pipes and create automatic sorting systems. It's also needed for the Packing Stations.<br>

<br>

**Thanks for reading Mechanics, see you next briefing!**<br>
