# Brefing 1 (3/7/2020)

Hello, it is I, the man who has completely gone crazy and has a literal corkboard in their room with a drawing of a farmbot and tallies next to it counting how many days we've gone without survival.<br> 
I will post predictions and things that I've found by searching game files or backlogging the dev's twitter life.<br>
I will do this by posting daily briefings that contain info found that day and the current changenumber of the app. Stay informed, mechanics!<br>
