# Briefing 19 (5/4/2020)

## Hey! So after calming down a bit from the hype I am now able to actually take a look at it! So yeah. Let's go!

**WAREHOUSES.** Ok so this is actually cheating it's not only Warehouses here. By this I mean, we haven't seen warehouses. We know these are in game though, however we have also not seen some other, uh, i'd say pretty important stuff. Don't get me wrong, I like what we've seen, but it looks like there's no Propane Stations, Colored farmbot variants and modular spudguns. This kinda preoccupies me. Of course, there's still a chance this is just not in the prerelease, but I'm kinda skeptical. I like the game so far, but I was really hoping for some more enemy variety even if it was just the different colors. Which leads me to my next point:

**What don't we know about?** This might seem like a dumb question but until 2 days from now we didn't really know about slave trading. So I think we still lack some stuff. It seems like some of the ambitious stuff might have gotten cut, like Scrapyards and Propane Stations. I think about half of these are just not on the prerelease, but IDK, this might end up being smaller than we thought.

**At the end of the day though, the game is great.** The update already looks amazing. I can't wait to hop into creative and see everything new! Only 3-2 days to go!

**I'm off for now! Bye!**
