**New STEAM BUILD.** It is literally called Survival prerelease. It is LITERALLY CALLED SURVIVAL PRERELEASE. OH MY GOD. There were like 10 updates between that build and test_dev today. My prediction is it's going to be a build for youtubers to try out earlier than May 7th, but who knows, maybe the devs surprise us! For now though, I don't see it happening.

**New tweeet! AGAIN!** I am pretty sure we are getting daily tweets until May 7th now. So uh, the tweet itself hasn't got anything new, but the comments reveal some big things. First, we will pump water out of lakes and seas to get it. Cardboard doesn't soak in water. Crops are not movable (This is not bad I'll explain later). Backpacks are cosmetic and big thing, Farmbots go after your crops, not you. This means if you don't plant you don't get attacked, but you also don't get food. The nonmovable crops thing seems good because it will make the game more balanced, seeing how you could just outrun the farmbots with a car.

**That's it for today, also tired as hell lmao**
