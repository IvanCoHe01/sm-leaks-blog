## LET'S GO I'M NOT DEAD AND THERE'S NEWS SO WE'RE DOING THIS AGAIN I LIED

**Ok so survival is out yay.** Thanks devpeople it looks very good.

**News.** Ok so basically, we got some news today. First: There will be a lot of bufixes this month. Second: Challengemode will be relaunched this month as well. Third: They are going to tweak the UI and fix translations and FOUR: We might get a content update this month, I'm not sure. They said they would be focused on adding new content to survival this month. Also, adding the content to creative as well.

**MORE NEWS but not in steam.** They also replied to some tweets! The thing near the cockpit is a future update (Probably lore logbook), and they seem interested into looking into consoles right now (yay).

**Ok so I'll probably not post that much now because we have survival and there's not much news but I'll keep you all informed. Bye!**
