# Briefing 20 (5/4/2020)

## It's the last briefing. After 4 years of waiting survival will be here in less than 24h. There's not much to talk about today, but I'll try to recap it all.

**ðŸ¦€ FENOWORKS DID AN OOPSIE ðŸ¦€** Ok I'm not going to go into the drama here but I am going to go into what he leaked. There's chemical containers, concave wedges, a BUNCH of new blocks and parts and basically he went into a Warehouse but everyone got mad at him so he left. You need a key to enter though. So that's interesting.

**The prerelease has updated!** It fixed some minor text-related bugs and some other stuff as well. It also made some tiles less exploitable.

**And uh, that's it.**

**This is it**

**Less than 24h left**

**Small speech:** When I started playing the game, I never thought I'd have to wait 4 years for this update. The wait, however, was worth it as we can see in the prerelease. I remember reading the devlogs when they came out and thinking to myself "Oh this is cool, shame it will never come out". I never considered the possiblity of Survival ever existing! But here we are. This is, sincerely, one of my top 3 gaming experiences of all time. Just sitting here, scraping every little detail I could. I reached slightly physcotic levels (btw isli if you are reading I know basically the entire timeline of the company, even the not really public stuff). It was so fun to be a slightly stalking detective in the last 3 months leading up to this. And the only reason I have had this ungodly hype is because we were talking about bearings in class 3 months ago and I remembered the game... Idk what it is that Axolot does with hype, but sincerely, how do you manage to make not the single thing I have been most hyped about in my life but publish the SECOND thing I have been most hyped about in my life? So isli, if you are reading, personally thank the dev team in my behalf please, for the 123 brief yet really fun hours I have spent playing this game. It's been an awesome time and I can't wait to see what you come up with next! And to this community, also thanks for letting me be a part of it. It's been fun to chat with you guys. And thanks Turbo for this channel, means a lot that you would do this for a stranger you met on the internet lmao so yeah. It's been a long time. I can't wait to see what the future of this game beholds.

**This got a little emotional didn't it. Anyway, bye!**
