# Brefing 11 (4/23/2020)

## Hi Mechani- wait no that's not my intro. Hey, human beings! So we have some new updates today. Let's look at them:

**The internal survival build was updated twice.** This is basically what I talked about yesterday. This time it was rapidly updated twice, probably because they found a bug that needed to be patched on the first version. Interesting, but there's not much we can do with it. 

**The Exosuit: That thing everyone always forgets about.** Seriously, why is no one talking about it? It seems like an amazing idea. Instead of having armor that just boosts your defense and that is easily replacable we have a machine that enhances all your stats and isn't replacable. Fenowork proposed that it might be upgradable, since the concept art and the actual model are very different. I'd say this is most likely true.

**Farmbot variants and where to find them (Well actually we don't know that yet).** I'm guessing there's 4 variants of every kind of enemy robot. Green, Red, Yellow and Blue. We have only seen Green and Red for now but there are yellow and blue totebot heads so I'd say that confirms it. It's unknown if these are just variant skins or actual different enemies, but I'm willing to bet that they are purely cosmetic. Also, Tapebots have a tape-entangled variant and an unentangled variant. So uh, cool I guess.

**That's it for today Mechanics. See you all next briefing!**
