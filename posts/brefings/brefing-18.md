# Briefing 18 (5/3/2020)

## Ok so the prerelease is out. This is old news now, obviouly, BUT, you might not know about what isn't in the prerelease!

**70% OF ALL CRAFTS ARE GONE ðŸ¦€**  Ok, so only 30% of the items that will be craftable are craftable in the prerelease. This means we still have A LOT of stuff to see, which makes big hype. Also, no, Spudguns aren't craftable. You need to...

**SLAVE TRADING. NOT A JOKE.** You can trade people in survival for guns. This is not a joke. So there are these caged farmers you might find around the map? Yeah uh, those are sellable to the Market Farmers. And you can buy guns with it! 5 of them plus 30 of a specific fruit for each spudgun. This is truly big brain.

**Creative is getting all the new stuff.** That's it. Oh also, trees and rocks are parts, so @TechnologicNick was right about that. Big brain.

**The map is 10x the size**

**THERE might BE LORE.** Ok so you know that L button that can't be pressed in the prerelease? That's a Raft-styled logbook. That's all we know.

**That's it for today! This is truly a big brain move by the devs, very cool.**
