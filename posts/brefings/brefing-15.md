## Hey guys! So we've got a lot of stuff to cover today. It's time to explain while I listen to Pigstep.

**ACTUAL NEWS YESSS.** Oh my god It's been so long, since I last have seen an update lost to this farmbot, to the man behind the slaught- I mean yeah we got a hidden update today. Now there is actual survival cloud saving. When survival comes out saves will be separated from creative. The ability for you to cloud save in survival has already been added. Now we just need the actual update lmao.

**Farmbois.** Ok so first I need to talk about the big red chunky farmbot. My guess is that this boss gives you an item to acess a secret room in the Warehouse. The one with the battery in the wall? Yeah that one. You see, I think that we will need to repair the ship in survival, and that battery is needed to power it up. So we need to take it. Then when we take it that Warehouse will lose all it's power and you will need to flee while everything is dark. But you can't get there without the key, and you probably can't break in due to the encryptor. The other farmbois are also cool. Totebots have a fuse which when it gets burnt, it explodes (Totebot? Aww man!) and they are found in Propane stations and raids. Haybots seem to be the basic enemy that is found everywhere. Tapebots shoot tape and can be found at Warehouses. They also do big ouchie. The sickle guy has a sickle and that's all we know.

**That's it for today humans.** *See you tommorrow! also do all your work before the 7th seriously you might be in crunch mode for a week but it's better than survival being out and not playing it in the exact 5.9 secs after its release*
