*They told us there were no active volcanoes here but yknow, they have been known to be wrong... on many levels:*<br>

I think that something will be there. Probably lore stuff, but who knows.<br>

Don't quote me on this, but i'm seeing this being an Exosuit upgrade, kinda like a NMS styled jetpack<br>

*Editors Note:* IvanCoHe (the person whos been writing all of these brefings) left shortly after this for unknown reasons. (Ivan if you see this we hope you come back some day.)
